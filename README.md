# AluGames Project

This project was developed through the Alura development course, wich I learned how to:

- Analyze the code of an HTML page to understand its structure and plan the code for its functionality;
- Retrieve page elements with JavaScript, using the functions `document.querySelector()` and `document.getElementById()`;
- Declare variables in JavaScript to store items retrieved from the page;
- Access the list of classes that a page element has, via the **classList** property;
- Check if a page element has a certain CSS class, via the `classList.contains()` function;
- Removes a CSS class from a page element, via the `classList.remove()` function;
- Add a CSS class to a page element, via the `classList.add()` function;
- Change the text of a page element, via the **textContent** property;
- Declare a conditional block **if/else**, to implement the functionality for changing a game's status.
